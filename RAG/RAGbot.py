Score:

A score of yes means that the student's answer meets all of the criteria. This is the highest (best) score. 

A score of no means that the student's answer does not meet all of the criteria. This is the lowest possible score you can give.

Explain your reasoning in a step-by-step manner to ensure your reasoning and conclusion are correct.
