# **README**

## **Project Overview**
Building a localized chatbot using **Ollama**, **Llama 3.1**, and **LangChain** to explore and learn how to build with **LLMs (Large Language Models)**. This project showcases two versions of the chatbot: a terminal-based version and a simple UI version.

## **How to Run**

### **Version 1: Terminal-Based Chatbot**
A simple chatbot that runs directly in your terminal.

**Run it using one of the following commands:**
```bash
python version1.py
```
or
```bash
py version1.py
```S

### **Version 2: UI-Based Chatbot**
A chatbot with a simple and interactive user interface (UI) built with **Streamlit**.

**Run it using the following command:**
```bash
streamlit run version2.py
```

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Core programming language for building chatbot logic.
- **Ollama**: For managing and interacting with self-hosted LLMs.
- **Llama 3.1**: The model powering the chatbot's responses.
- **LangChain**: For prompt chaining and improved LLM workflows.
- **Streamlit**: To create a simple UI for Version 2.

---

## **Notes**
- Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed before running the chatbot.
- Version 1 offers a no-frills terminal experience, while Version 2 provides a more user-friendly UI.
- This project serves as a learning experience for working with LLMs, with plans for future expansion and feature development.

Happy Chatting! ðŸš€
