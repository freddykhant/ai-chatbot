# **README**

## **Project Overview**
building a localized chatbot using **Ollama**, **Llama 3.1**, and **LangChain** to explore and learn how to build with **LLMs (Large Language Models)**. this project has two versions of the chatbot: a terminal-based version and a simple UI version.

## **How to Run**

###Terminal-Based Chatbot**
a simple chatbot that runs directly in your terminal.

**Run it using one of the following commands:**
```bash
python chatbot-terminal.py
```
or
```bash
py chatbot-terminal.py
```

### **UI-Based Chatbot**
a chatbot with a simple and interactive user interface (UI) built with **Streamlit**.

**Run it using the following command:**
```bash
streamlit run chatbot-ui.py
```

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: core programming language for building chatbot logic
- **Ollama**: for managing and interacting with self-hosted LLMs
- **Llama 3.1**: the model powering the chatbot's responses
- **LangChain**: for prompt chaining and improved LLM workflows
- **Streamlit**: to create a simple UI for Version 2

## **Note**
- ensure all necessary dependencies are installed before running the chatbot.
- assuming, you have python and pip installed, this can be done by running the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
